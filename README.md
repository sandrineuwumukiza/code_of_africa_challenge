# Coding Challenge
# coding challenges is contained in challenges foler which contains two files: arrayMaps.js and stringTransform.js

##  1: Array Manipulation
## This is found in arrayMaps.js which is a function to help to check if the array contains substring which return the target sum if it is found it return true if not it retun force, in this function i had written a test code to help me check if what i had done was true
## to run or to test the function you  have to run in terminal node arrayMaps.js and the answers will be displayed in the console
` node arryMaps.js `

## 2: String Transformation
## .This challenge is found in stringTransform.js which contains a function to help me check if string is divisible by 3 and 5 or both of them, if it is divisible by 3 it will return the reversed version of the original string, if it is divisible by 5 it will return the ASCII code of the string, if it divisible by both 3 and 5 or 15 it will consider both reversed string and ASCII code, otherwise it will return the original string.To run or to test the function you have to use 
` node stringTransform.js` 
## in the terminal
